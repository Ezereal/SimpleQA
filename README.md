    This is a simple QASystem, writed by python3.6.

    You should install the library of jieba and bs4, and then you can use this QA system.
    And you can use the following two lines of command to install the libraries:
    ...pip3 install jieba
    ...pip3 install bs4
    You can also use other methods to install the libraries what i just said, but
no matter which way you use it, you should make sure the libraries can be used in python3.

    If the keywords or categories are changed,the traindata_read.py should be run to
update the featurefile.
